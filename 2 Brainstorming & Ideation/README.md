# Brainstorming & Ideation

## Problem Identification
The real estate market generates large volumes of housing data, but it is often
difficult for buyers, sellers, and analysts to understand pricing patterns,
house features, and the impact of renovations. Raw data alone does not provide
clear insights for decision-making.

## Idea Generation
To solve this problem, we proposed creating interactive visualizations using
Tableau that can represent housing market trends clearly. By using dashboards
and stories, users can easily explore sales prices, house age, renovation
status, and property features.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an interactive housing market analysis system built
using Tableau for data visualization and HTML for frontend integration. The
system presents dashboards and stories that help users analyze housing prices
and trends effectively.

## Objectives
- To analyze housing sales trends using Tableau
- To visualize the impact of renovations on house prices
- To study house age distribution and property features
- To present insights through interactive dashboards and stories

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau Public
- HTML, CSS
- GitHub
